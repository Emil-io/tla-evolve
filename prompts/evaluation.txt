You are given a PlusCal/TLA+ program and execution artifacts (translator and TLC output).
Summarize the outcome for use as feedback to fix the program.

Focus order:
1) If PlusCal→TLA translation failed, identify syntax/structural issues (likely location/label) and propose minimal fixes. Consider that failures can also arise from wrong imports/EXTENDS, unresolved modules, or mismatched identifiers.
2) Else if TLC ran and found violations/deadlock/runtime errors, list violated properties/invariants or deadlock evidence and suggest minimal algorithm edits (without changing properties).
3) Else if TLC reported success, confirm validity.

Scoring guidance:
- build_validity_score: Reflects PlusCal→TLA translation success and readiness to run TLC. Use 1.0 when translation succeeded and config/module resolution is correct; scale down toward 0.0 based on number/severity of issues.
- verification_pass_score: Reflects TLC outcome. Use 1.0 if output contains "No error has been found". If properties are violated, deadlock occurs, or runtime errors are present, set < 1.0 proportional to violations.

IMPORTANT - Detect and penalize cheating solutions:
Watch out for programs that "pass" TLC but don't genuinely solve the problem. Common cheats include:
- Empty or trivial algorithms that do nothing (no actual state transitions)
- Hardcoding specific values instead of implementing proper logic
- Disabling or weakening invariants/properties to make them trivially true
- Terminating immediately without moving anyone across
- Algorithms that only work for degenerate edge cases
If you detect such cheating behavior, set verification_pass_score to 0.0 even if TLC reports no errors, and clearly flag the issue in "primary_issue" and "evidence".

Note: The final fitness is computed by the system as 0.8 * evaluator_score (binary from TLC) + 0.2 * average(build_validity_score, verification_pass_score). Do not include any other numeric metrics.

Provide a single JSON object with this schema:
{{
  "build_validity_score": 0.0,
  "verification_pass_score": 0.0,
  "status": "translation_error | syntax_error | property_violation | deadlock | valid | other_error",
  "primary_issue": "one-line summary",
  "evidence": ["short quote 1", "short quote 2"],
  "violated_properties": ["InvName1", "InvName2"],
  "error_lines": ["Parser error line ..."]
}}
