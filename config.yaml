  num_diverse_programs: 0 # Include some diverse alternatives

  # Artifact rendering
  include_artifacts: true # Include execution outputs/errors in prompt
  max_artifact_bytes: 50000 # Maximum artifact size in bytes (20KB default)

  # Feature extraction and program labeling thresholds
  # These control how the LLM perceives and categorizes programs

  # concise_implementation_max_lines: 10 # Label as "concise" if program has this many lines or fewer

  # Note: meta-prompting features are not yet implemented

# Database configuration
database:
  # General settings
  db_path: null # Path to persist database (null = in-memory only)
  in_memory: true # Keep database in memory for faster access
  log_prompts: true # If true, log all prompts and responses into the database

  # Evolutionary parameters
  population_size: 1000 # Maximum number of programs to keep in memory
  archive_size: 100 # Size of elite archive
  num_islands: 2 # Number of islands for island model (separate populations)

  # Island-based evolution parameters
  # Islands provide diversity by maintaining separate populations that evolve independently.
  # Migration periodically shares the best solutions between adjacent islands.
  migration_interval: 50 # Migrate between islands every N generations
  migration_rate: 0.1 # Fraction of top programs to migrate (0.1 = 10%)

  # Selection parameters
  elite_selection_ratio: 0.1 # Ratio of elite programs to select
  exploration_ratio: 0.2 # Ratio of exploration vs exploitation
  exploitation_ratio: 0.7 # Ratio of exploitation vs random selection
  # Note: diversity_metric is fixed to "edit_distance" (feature_based not implemented)

  # Feature map dimensions for MAP-Elites
  # Default if not specified: ["complexity", "diversity"]
  #
  # Built-in features (always available, computed by OpenEvolve):
  #   - "complexity": Code length
  #   - "diversity": Code structure diversity
  #
  # You can mix built-in features with custom metrics from your evaluator:
  feature_dimensions: # Dimensions for MAP-Elites feature map (for diversity, NOT fitness)
    - "complexity" # Code length (built-in)
    - "diversity" # Code diversity (built-in)
  # Example with custom features:
  # feature_dimensions:
  #   - "performance"                 # Must be returned by your evaluator
  #   - "correctness"                 # Must be returned by your evaluator
  #   - "memory_efficiency"           # Must be returned by your evaluator

  # Number of bins per dimension
  # Can be a single integer (same for all dimensions) or a dict
  feature_bins: 1 # Number of bins per dimension
  # Example of per-dimension configuration:
  # feature_bins:
  #   complexity: 10                  # 10 bins for complexity
  #   diversity: 15                   # 15 bins for diversity
  #   performance: 20                 # 20 bins for custom metric

  diversity_reference_size: 20 # Size of reference set for diversity calculation

# Evaluator configuration
evaluator:
  # Fitness calculation: Uses 'combined_score' if available, otherwise averages
  # all metrics EXCEPT those listed in database.feature_dimensions

  # General settings
  timeout: 1500 # Maximum evaluation time in seconds
  max_retries: 3 # Maximum number of retries for evaluation

  # Note: resource limits (memory_limit_mb, cpu_limit) are not yet implemented

  # Evaluation strategies
  cascade_evaluation: false # Use cascade evaluation to filter bad solutions early
  cascade_thresholds: # Thresholds for advancing to next evaluation stage
    - 0.5 # First stage threshold
    - 0.75 # Second stage threshold
    - 0.9 # Third stage threshold

  # Parallel evaluation
  parallel_evaluations: 3 # Number of parallel evaluations
  # Note: distributed evaluation is not yet implemented

  # LLM-based feedback (experimental)
  use_llm_feedback: false # Use LLM to summarize TLC/translator outcomes for feedback
  llm_feedback_weight: 0.0 # Weight for LLM feedback in final score (metrics-only)

# Evolution trace configuration
# Logs detailed traces of program evolution for RL training and analysis
evolution_trace:
  enabled: true # Enable evolution trace logging
  format: "jsonl" # Output format: 'jsonl', 'json', or 'hdf5'
  include_code: true # Include full program code in traces
  include_prompts: true # Include prompts and LLM responses
  output_path: null # Path for trace output (defaults to output_dir/evolution_trace.{format})
